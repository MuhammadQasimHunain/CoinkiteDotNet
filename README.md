# CoinkiteDotNet
.net library for coinkite


Work has only just begun on this project, but it should be an ideal library for usage.

You can create a new CoinKite interface by using

`ICoinKite test = new ICoinKiteService(api_key, api_secret)`

Which can then be used by doing

`test.someFunction(someparameters)`

Once complete this should cover most API functions, including ones related to multi-sig.
